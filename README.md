## Intro

This is the version 1 of my HNGi7 Leaderboard project, it a very limited UI as at the time of release with my focus being mainly on functionality. 
It was first published after a 8 hour code sprint. It utilitizes Firebase for its backend functionality, axios for fetch api functionality, and material-ui.
Subsequent enhancements will follow for functionality and UI.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).	This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
